## Main topics

- Component Nesting: A component can be shown inside another component
- Component Reusability: We want to make components easily reusable
- Component Configuration: We should be able to configure our components

## Application overview

We want to build a small app that shows a number of comments with image, name, time and text.

## Steps to create reusable componets

- identify the JSX that appers to be duplicated;
- identify the purpose of this JSX, think of a descriptive name;
- create a new file to house this new component with the same name as the component;
- create new component if this file
- make it configurable through `props` system
