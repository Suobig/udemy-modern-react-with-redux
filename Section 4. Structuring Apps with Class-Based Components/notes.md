## Class and function based components

Class-based components appeared first and they provided all the functionality:

1. produce JSX and show content to the user;
2. use Lifecycle methods
3. use 'state' stytem

Function-based components at first only had the first functionality. But they they got full functionality with Hooks.

Using hooks function-based components can run code at specific points in time (which is similar to Lifecycle methods) and access state system.

Most legacy React apps use only class components. But newer apps use either both class and function components or function components only.

In this course we will start with class-based components, because they're easier to understand, and then move to function-based components.
